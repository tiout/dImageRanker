Wrote this program to learn wxPython and develop something my wife could
use to comb through our 2000 wedding photos and decide which she wanted 
to get prints of.  Basically, you can import entire directories (recursively)
or individual files, rank the photos, save your session (as a python pickle
file), restore your session, and export the photoes of a certain rank to
another folder.  Should only need Python (my version 2.5) and wxPython (my 
version 2.8.10).
