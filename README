Wrote this program to learn wxPython and develop something my wife could
use to comb through our 2000+ wedding photos and decide which she wanted 
to get prints of.  Basically, you can import entire directories (recursively) or individual files, rank the photos, save your session (as a python pickle file), restore your session, and export the photoes of a certain rank to another folder.  Should only need Python (my version 2.5) and wxPython (my version 2.8.10).

With the 9/11/2010 commit, I added an exif tag viewer that also requires Python Imaging Library (PIL).  Mainly, I just wanted to play with reading Exif data, but wanted to include PIL anyway so that I could ultimately add functionality to batch resize images on export.  Also planning to add a preferences menu when I get around to it, so I may make the PIL features optional.
